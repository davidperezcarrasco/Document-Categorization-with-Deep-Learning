# Document Categorization with Deep Learning using Pre-Trained Word Embeddings

This project investigates document categorization using advanced deep learning methods and pre-trained word embeddings, leveraging the power of modern neural networks to improve text classification accuracy. The models were trained and evaluated using multiple architectures, including MLPs, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, and their combinations.

## Key Features

- **Pre-Trained Word Embeddings**: Utilizes GloVe and fastText embeddings to enhance the semantic understanding of text.
- **Neural Network Architectures**: Implements a variety of deep learning models, including:
  - Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
  - Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Stacked and Bidirectional LSTMs
- **Parameter Tuning**: Extensive experimentation with embedding sizes, padding and truncating strategies, batch sizes, and sequence lengths.
- **Text and Document Understanding**: Employs deep learning techniques to capture complex patterns and relationships within textual data.
